# **Overview**
This section will detail what is needed to setup, power on, connect to, and configure the RAK Wireless Developer gateway and its Raspberry Pi. This is the basis of the entire pea-POD project and proper setup will necessary as it is the basis for every other step. The following instructions are copied from the [RAK Quickstart Guide](https://github.com/adamschreck/pea-pod/files/10867195/RAK.Quickstart.Guide.pdf), but has been adapted to further clarify steps.

# **Steps**

###General

1. Check to make sure you have obtained all of the following. Some components can be swapped out **before beginning** for various purposes. A micro SD card with a higher GB capacity can be used for increased storage. Higher power antennas can be connected to increase the range that the gateway can be from a sensor. Antennas or power supplies could also appear different if you are using a weatherproof case.

2. Connect the GPS antenna and LoRa antenna (show in the above figure) to the terminals of the gateway by screwing until snug. Below is a diagram that identifies which terminal is coordinated with what antenna, it is crucial that this conducted correctly.

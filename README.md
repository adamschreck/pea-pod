# Introduction
This repository is intended to serve as a build guide for the pea-POD, a small Raspberry-Pi based server and LoRaWAN gateway that has been configured to help individuals establish their own IoT (Internet of Things) systems for agricultural applicaitons. This work has been done by members of the OATS (Open Ag Tech and Systems) research group at Purdue University, and is a part of the larger POD (Purdue OATS DataStation) iniative to share the benefits of LoRaWAN with farmeers and others with an interest in data collection and IoT. Regardless of experience level or technical background, by following this guide step-by-step readers should be able to establish their own LoRaWAN network and begin collecting data that can translate to improved insights.

For those who have no coding or computer science background this project may seem intimidating, and issues may occur along the way for which this manual does not include a solution. Each component of this system has been chosen for the existing documentation provided by the manufacturers and the amount of community support. This means that with persistence and a problem-solving mindset nearly anything can be solved with an online searching. For those with domain expertise, this system can be a jumping off point. If there is a sensor that you want to add or other data that you want to pull in, then this can be a strong base to build from.
